## Future Goals : 
While this application is fully functional and production-grade, it is currently in the testing phase, and several improvements are planned for future updates. This is just the first phase of development.

**Planned Enhancements:**

1. **Message Acceptance Button:** Currently, the button operates on an optimistic UI/update principle, which can lead to occasional inconsistencies. Future updates will aim to refine this functionality.
2. **AI Integration:** Due to cost constraints, AI-generated messages are utilized at present. I plan to integrate the Hugging Face API in a more effective manner in future updates.
3. **Email Service:** I intend to transition to Nodemailer for email services, as it offers a free tier and is expected to enhance the application's performance.
4. **Google OAuth:** Integration of Google OAuth is on the roadmap to provide users with additional authentication options.
